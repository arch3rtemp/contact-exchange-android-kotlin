## Architecture & Branches
This repository demonstrates different Android architecture approaches. Each branch contains the **same app functionality** but uses different tech stacks and patterns:

1. **MVVM-MVI** (branch: `master`)  
   - **Kotlin**  
   - Clean Architecture + MVVM + MVI patterns  
   - **Kotlin Coroutines** / **Kotlin Flow** for asynchronous/reactive operations  
   - **Tests**: Kotlin Test, MockK, Robolectric

2. **Compose** (branch: `compose`)  
   - **Kotlin**  
   - **Jetpack Compose** for the UI  
   - In progress / partial implementation  
   - Plans to leverage the same Clean Architecture and Coroutines Flow approach

---

## Technologies Used
- **Room** (local database storage)  
- **ML Kit** for QR scanner functionality (scan contact QR codes)  
- **JUnit / Kotlin Test** for unit testing  
- **MockK** for mocking dependencies  
- **Robolectric** for Android-specific unit tests  
- **Gradle** build system
